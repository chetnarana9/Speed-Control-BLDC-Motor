# Speed-Control-BLDC-Motor
Overview:

This project demonstrates PWM-based speed control of a Brushless DC (BLDC) motor using NodeMCU ESP8266 and an Electronic Speed Controller (ESC). The system enables smooth motor operation with real-time speed monitoring using Hall sensors and IoT-based control.

Key Features:
1. PWM-based speed control via NodeMCU ESP8266
2. ESC-driven electronic commutation of BLDC motor
3. Hall sensor–based RPM measurement
4. Real-time speed display on 16×2 LCD
5. IoT monitoring using Blynk platform

Working Principle: NodeMCU generates a PWM signal (1–2 ms, 50 Hz). ESC interprets PWM and drives the BLDC motor. Hall sensors measure motor speed (RPM). Speed data is displayed on LCD and can be monitored remotely.

Components Used: NodeMCU ESP8266, BLDC Motor (1000 KV), Electronic Speed Controller (ESC), Hall-effect sensors, 16×2 LCD Display, Power supply, jumper wires

Outcomes:
1. Achieved PWM-based speed control of a BLDC motor using NodeMCU and ESC
2. Demonstrated stable motor operation with electronic commutation
3. Enabled real-time RPM monitoring using Hall-effect sensors
4. Integrated Blynk IoT platform for remote speed control and monitoring
5. Built and tested a fully functional hardware prototype

Learnings:
1. Understanding of BLDC motor operation and ESC interfacing
2. Practical knowledge of PWM techniques for motor speed regulation
3. Experience with sensor interfacing and RPM measurement
4. Hands-on exposure to IoT platforms (Blynk) and Wi-Fi–based control
5. Improved skills in hardware assembly, debugging, and system integration
